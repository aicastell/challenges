# What is in this repo

This repo contais some programming challenges:

- The Greplin Programming Challenge
- CodeChef

## The Greplin Programming Challenge

This is my set of solutions for this challenge:

### Level 1

Embedded in this block of text is the password for level 2.
The password is the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast"
the password would be "racecar"

### Level 2

Congratulations.  You have reached level 2.

To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime
fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

When you are ready, go here or call this automated
number (415) 799-9454.

You will receive additional instructions at that time.  For the second portion
of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors
to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.

### Level 3

Congratulations.  You have reached the final level.

For the final task, you must find all subsets of an array
where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

the subsets would be

1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 4 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on.
The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the
answer would be 4.

### The End

Congratulations.  You completed the challenge.  Your completion code is 118-170-234969.

We'd love to talk to you - send your completion code, the code you wrote
during the challenge, and your resume to

USER at SUBDOMAIN dot DOMAIN

Even if you're not looking for a job, we'd love to hear what you thought
about the challenge.
